This directory contains metadata files matching an Iceberg table created with the
following command

  CREATE TABLE ice_puffin(
    bool_col BOOLEAN,
    int_col INT,
    bigint_col BIGINT,
    float_col FLOAT,
    double_col DOUBLE,
    date_col DATE,
    string_col STRING,
    timestamp_col TIMESTAMP)
  STORED BY ICEBERG";

The metadata.json and the avro files are taken from a table created with the above command
and then truncated (truncation is needed so that a snapshot exists).

The metadata files in the "generated" subdirectory are created with the
PuffinDataGenerator tool in "java/puffin-data-generator". The metadata.json file here is
used by that tool as a template.
To re-generate the metadata files, run the following from the Impala home directory:

  mvn -f "java/puffin-data-generator/pom.xml" exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.impala.puffin_data_generator.PuffinDataGenerator";

This will generate files in the "puffin_files" directory, which must previously be empty
or non-existent. The generated files can then be copied into the "generated" subdirectory
here.
